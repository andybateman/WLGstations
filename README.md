Interesting mapping with the Train Stations around Wellington, NZ

[Have a look at how far I've got here](http://rawgit.com/andybateman/WLGStations/master/index.html)

If you have a look at or use the stations.js for location information, the elevations are in measured in metres.

[Things still to do](TODO.md)
